Nazghul requires linux and the following libraris:

    SDL-1.2............http://www.libsdl.org
    libSDL_image-1.2...http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

To compile and install nazghul:

        ./configure; make; make install

(Note: if you don't want to install as root then use the --prefix option with
configure. E.g., ./configure --prefix=$HOME)

The install presumes that the bin/ subdir of the --prefix where you
installed nazghul is in your PATH.  Ergo, if you install to $HOME then
the nazghul binary lives in $HOME/bin/nazghul and would need $HOME/bin
in your PATH.

To test out the example world:

        cd examples; nazghul
