BUILDING AND INSTALLING

Nazghul has been built on linux, cygwin (Windows) and MacOS.

Nazghul requires the following libraries:

        SDL-1.2............http://www.libsdl.org
        libSDL_image-1.2...http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
        libpng.............http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

To compile and install nazghul:

        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install
    
(Note: if you don't want to install as root then use the --prefix option with
configure. E.g., ./configure --prefix=$HOME)

The install presumes that the bin subdirectory of the --prefix where you
installed nazghul is in your PATH.  Ergo, if you install to $HOME then the
nazghul binary lives in $HOME/bin/nazghul and would need $HOME/bin in your
PATH.

If you have problems see the FAQ below and if that fails try
nazghul-users@lists.sourceforge.net.


STARTING THE GAME

        $ cd world/haxima-1.002
        $ nazghul


TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: MY COMPUTER IS OLD AND THE GAME IS TOO SLOW

A: If you are running with a slow machine (<= 133Mhz) or a slow video card then
   try the following options to help performance:

        $ nazghul --tick -1 haxima.scm

   This will start nazghul with no animation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I GET LOTS OF ANNOYING MESSAGES ABOUT MY SOUND CARD NOT WORKING
   or THE SOUND LAGS BADLY ON MY WINDOWS BOX

A: Start nazghul with sound disabled:

        $ nazghul --sound 0 haxima.scm

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: WHEN I TRY TO BUILD I GET A LINK ERROR ABOUT SDL_Image

A: Do this and then re-run ./configure and try again:

        $ export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
        $ ./configure
        $ ...etc

   Or, if you know that SDL_image is installed in some other directory specify
   that instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: WHEN I TRY AND RUN IT ON MY WINDOWS SYSTEM I GET AN ERROR ABOUT
   SDL_image.dll.

A: Copy SDL_image.dll from wherever it is on your system to the same directory
   from which you invoke nazghul. If you need SDL_image Google around or
   checkout libsdl.org.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: WHILE I WAS PLAYING THE GAME IT SUDDENLY CRASHED

A: Please report it to nazghul-user@lists.sourceforge.net or submit a bug on
   the sourceforge site.
