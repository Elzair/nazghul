BUILDING AND INSTALLING

Nazghul requires linux and the following libraris:

    SDL-1.2............http://www.libsdl.org
    libSDL_image-1.2...http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

To compile and install nazghul:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

(Note: if you don't want to install as root then use the --prefix option with
configure. E.g., ./configure --prefix=$HOME)

The install presumes that the bin subdirectory of the --prefix where you
installed nazghul is in your PATH.  Ergo, if you install to $HOME then the
nazghul binary lives in $HOME/bin/nazghul and would need $HOME/bin in your
PATH.


STARTING THE GAME

    cd examples
    nazghul


TIPS FOR SLOW COMPUTERS

If you are running with a slow machine (<= 133Mhz) or a slow video card then
try the following options to help performance:

    nazghul --tick -1 --bpp 8

This will start nazghul in 256-color mode with no animation.


TIPS FOR SOUND DRIVER PROBLEMS

Also, if you get a lot of annoying messages about your sound card not working,
you can disable sound:

    nazghul --sound 0
