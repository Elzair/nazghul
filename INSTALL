BUILDING AND INSTALLING

Nazghul requires the following libraries:

        SDL-1.2............http://www.libsdl.org
        libSDL_image-1.2...http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
        libSDL_image-1.2...http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
        libpng.............http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
        zlib
        
UNIXy systems

The libraries should be available as packages for most systems- you will
need dev versions of the packages, eg SDL_dev-1.2.deb

To compile and install nazghul from a tarball:

        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install
    
(If you don't want to install as root then use the --prefix option with
configure. E.g., ./configure --prefix=$HOME)

To compile and install from a CVS checkout rather than a milestone
tarball:

        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ make
        $ make install
        
The --prefix option may be applied to autogen in the same manner as
configure.

STARTING THE GAME

To run haxima, the game that comes packaged with the engine:

        $ haxima.sh

WIN32

The prebuilt installers should simply be a case of download and click.

Setting up a compilation environment and libraries for a cvs build can
be more tricky: Detailed instuctions are available in win32/readme.txt
