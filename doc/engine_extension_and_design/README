This directory contains miscellaneous notes on extending and designing
the Haxima engine.

The contents of this directory do not necessarily correspond to what
_IS_ in the game engine/kernal, but to things which have been proposed
to be added.  Keeping these sort of notes in CVS seems like a better
way to communicate than each developer keeping their own notes which
get lost.
