Places
------

Wilderness:

In the outdoor or wilderness map the party moves as a single unit. You can
enter into combat with enemy NPC parties by moving into them or waiting for
them to attack you. Likewise you can enter towns, dungeons or moongates by
simply walking into them.

Wilderness Combat:

This is a special temporary combat map that pops up when you engage an enemy
NPC party in the wilderness. In this mode you control individual party
members. You return to the wilderness map by having all of your living party
members walk off the edge of the map. (Hint: if combat is over you can press
<ESC> to quickly leave the map).

Towns/Dungeons:

In towns and dungeons you move just like in combat mode. You can control the
individual party members in turn, have one of them scout around in solo mode,
or control the leader and have the other party members follow.


Combat
------

Pretty much like u5. Try the flaming oil at night or in an underground place --
it's fun.


Magic
-----

There isn't much to speak of yet. The only 'magic' I've implemented are natural
abilities. The gazer in your party has a few spells, and if you add a gazer NPC
party to the mapfile then beware -- they can be quite dangerous!


Conversation
------------

Start a conversation with an NPC with the T)alk command. During conversation
you type simple inquiries and the NPC responds, sometimes asking you a question
in return. Conversations with shopkeepers will allow you to buy and sell
items. Most NPCs respond to the 'NAME', 'JOB', and 'HEALTH' queries. Their
responses usually give you clues to further fruitful queries. Also, with the
special 'JOIN' query you can ask an NPC to join your party (some will join you,
and some will join you only if you do or say something that impresses them).


Hacker's Addendum
-----------------

Like many games, "nazghul" is separated into an engine and a data file. In this
case the default data file is called 'mapfile' in the src. It's an ASCII
file, but I don't edit it directly to make changes. Instead I edit u5.naz which
defines the basic types and core.naz which lays out the maps, places and player
party. Then I 'make mapfile' to generate the mapfile using the C preprocessor.

If you want to experiment with changing the gamefile (and you probably will
since there isn't much to speak of right now) go ahead. The game.c file
contains most of the parsing code if you need to see the source to puzzle out
my bizarre format (it uses lexer.c to handle token processing).

I'm not going to try to explain the format because it is in a constant state
of evolution right now. You can see some older (possibly broken) examples in
the maps/ directory, including one that uses the moongates.
