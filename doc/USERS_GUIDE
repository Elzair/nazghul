                            USERS GUIDE TO NAZGHUL

Nazghul is an old-school RPG clone modeled after those made in the heyday of
top-down, 2d tile-based graphics. It is specifically modeled after Ultima V, so
if you've played that game then this should be familiar.


                              INSTALLING THE GAME

If you downloaded a source distribution see the top-level INSTALL file.

If you downloaded a windows binary just unzip the distribution using Winzip or
similar.


                               STARTING THE GAME


On Linux/UNIX:

      $ haxima.sh

On Windows:

      Use the start menu or desktop icon

You can play the Tutorial first or jump right in with Start New Game.


                                SAVING THE GAME

You can save your game at any time while playing by using the CTRL-S key
sequence for the S)ave command. An unlimited number of saved games is
permitted. When you restart, use the Journey Onward option from the main menu
to select a saved game to continue.

If you die, the game will exit, and when you restart it will pick up where you
last saved via the Journey Onward option.


                               EXITING THE GAME

You can quit at any time by pressing Q for the Q)uit commmand. It will prompt
you to save if you like and then exit.


                                  ORIENTATION

If you are unfamiliar with U5 I recommend the Tutorial option available from the
Main Menu when you start the game. Here are some more notes to help you get
started.

                                   Exploring

When you start you will have a party consisting of one character known
initially as The Wanderer. The icon for this character will be in the center of
the map view on the left. Explore around a bit using the arrow keys to
move. Below the map you'll see a little window with a prompt. This gives you
hints when you're entering commands to tell you what type of input the command
wants. For example, if you type 'x' (for e[x]amine) the command prompt will
say:

    Xamine-<target>(ESC to exit)

Which means it wants you to hit the arrow keys and move the targeting
cursor. When you hit 'ESC' instead the command will cancel. Pretty much all
commands can be canceled by hitting 'ESC'.

To get a detailed explanation of where you are and what time it is, use the AT
command by pressing '@'. There is no displayed clock in the game, so this is the
only way to tell time other than guesstimating from the position of the sun or
finding time telling devices inside the game.

                                    Talking

When you start the game, after selecting what kind of character to create, you'll
see your first NPC to the south. To talk to the NPC press 't' for T)alk.
This brings up a targeting crosshair. It might start out on the NPC or
on your character, it it's on you then move it to the NPC with the arrow keys
and hit enter. 

That starts a conversation. During conversation you enter a keyword and the NPC
will respond. For example, type NAME or JOB and see what this NPC says. When
you are done talking type 'bye' or hit enter by itself.

                                 Getting Stuff

Eventually you will want to follow the road down to the chamber on the lower
left. The chamber is marked by mysterious runes on its walls. Within the
chamber is a chest.

Walk over next to the chest and O)pen it by hitting 'o' and using your arrow
keys to indicate a direction. The chest will open and deposit a bunch of stuff
on the ground.

G)et the stuff using the 'g' key. Among the items will be some basic weapons,
armour and spell reagents as well as some scrolls and potions.

                                   Equipping

To see your stuff hit 'z' for Z)tats and scroll around. The left and right
arrow keys will switch between different status panes. Hit ESC when you tire of
admiring yourself and your loot.

To R)eady the weapons and armor hit 'r' then select them. Hit ESC when done.

                                 Mixing A Spell

To M)ix a heal spell type 'm' for mix. Next enter the spell name, in this case
'm' again for "Mani", and hit ENTER. Next, select Ginseng and Spider Silk from
the reagents list, and hit 'm' to mix them. Finally, you can mix batches of a
given spells at once, so you will need to input the quantity of "Mani" spells
you wish to produce. Enter '1' here, and you will have made a "Mani" spell, a
spell of minor healing. More on spells later. 

                          Entering and Exiting Towns

When you are ready to face the world walk to the edge of the map and bravely
step off. You will zoom out to Wilderness Mode, and your entire party (all one
of you) will appear as an icon in the center. To re-enter take a step south (at
which point you will see a shrine icon where you just were) and step north
again. Now you know how to enter and exit towns. Congrats.

When you enter a town, unless you have some enemies there, you will start out
in "follow mode", which means you control the party leader and everybody else
in the party tries to keep up. But if hostiles are in town you will be in
"character mode", which means you control each party member in turn. To switch
between these two mode use the 'f' key. This will make more sense when you have
more characters join your party.

IMPORTANT: when you eventually get somebody to join you, don't forget about
           Follow Mode (the 'f' key). It's much easier to have everybody follow
           your main dude around than to always individually control them.


                                USER INTERFACE

Astronomy Window

    Above the map you'll see a little window embedded in the frame which shows
    the position of the sun and two moons. It also shows the phase of the
    moons, which is important for moongate travel.

Wind

    Below the map, embedded in the frame, is the wind direction
    indicator. Currently the wind only affects ships. Tacking across the wind
    provides the best rate of travel, the wind at your back is second best, and
    heading into the wind is the worst. Note that this indicates the direction
    the wind is blowing _FROM_.

Command Prompt

    Unlike u4/u5/u6 the command prompt has its own window, just below the wind
    indicator. Interactive command prompts appear here, as well as the things
    the player says in conversation.

Status Window

    In the top right you have a general-purpose window for viewing and
    selecting lists of things. Normally it shows some basic party stats, but
    its contents change as required by user commands. For example, (R)eady will
    turn it into a selection list.

    Normally the window lists all the player's party members and shows their
    current hit points and status. The status is reflected in one or more
    little icons. For example, if a character is poisoned you'll see a little
    green skull-and-crossbones. You can get a better description of the status
    by using the Z)tatus command to inspect individual party members.

Foogod Window

    It sounds sacrilegious, but that's just my acronym for Food/Gold
    Window. This little window appears below the status window and shows the
    turn, food and gold counters as well as the current combat status and any
    active global effects (e.g., "Magic Negated"). If you board a vehicle it
    will also show you the hit points for the vehicle.  The effects are shown
    with cryptic little icons that appear until the effect expires.

    Magic Negated

        Spellcasting fails.

    Quicken

        Party members get extra turns per round.

    Reveal

        Invisible things are visible.

    Time Stop

        Everything in the world suspends while Party members get to move.

    X-ray Vision

        Party members can see through walls.

Console Window

    Finally on the right hand side you'll find the window where all the game
    messages get logged.


                                PLAYER COMMANDS


Here's your chance to let the sweat dry on your mouse - all commands are via
the keyboard. As it should be, forever and ever amen.

                                MOVEMENT MODES


Party Mode (wilderness)

    The party appears as a single icon in the center of the screen.

Follow Mode (town/combat/dungeons)

    You control the party leader and the other members follow the
    leader. Attacking a target will automatically switch to Round-Robin
    Mode. The party leader is always the top person in the list who is alive
    and still on the current map. Enter follow mode from Solo or Round Robin
    Mode by pressing 'f'.

Solo Mode (town/combat/dungeons)

    You control one party member while the others stand around looking
    bored. Enter Solo Mode by pressing the number key associated with the
    party member's order in the list. 1 is the first member in the list.

    NOTE: Solo mode can be very useful if one of your party members has greater
          passability than the others. For example, if a gazer joins your party
          he can float over water. Now imagine the possibilities if you get a
          ghost to join your party.

Round Robin Mode (town/combat/dungeons)

    You control each member in turn. This is the default mode when you enter
    combat. To enter Round Robin Mode from solo mode, press 0. To enter from
    Follow Mode press 'f'. Yes, confusing to have two methods. I'll fix it
    someday. Let me know if you have an opinion.


                                    PLACES

Wilderness:

    In the outdoor or wilderness map the party moves as a single unit. You can
    enter into combat with enemy NPC parties by moving into them or waiting for
    them to attack you. Likewise you can enter towns, dungeons or moongates by
    simply walking into them.

Wilderness Combat:

    This is a special temporary combat map that pops up when you engage an
    enemy NPC party in the wilderness. In this mode you control individual
    party members. You return to the wilderness map by having all of your
    living party members walk off the edge of the map. (Hint: if combat is over
    you can press <ESC> to quickly leave the map).

Towns/Dungeons:

    In towns and dungeons you move just like in combat mode. You can control
    the individual party members in turn, have one of them scout around in solo
    mode, or control the leader and have the other party members follow.


                                    COMBAT


What can I say? It's pretty much like u5. Try the flaming oil at night or in an
underground place. Oh, and watch out for gazers. They can charm you. Kill them
or charm them right away.


                                  ADVANCEMENT


As usual, characters advance a level when they gain sufficient experience
points. There is no maximum level limit. When a character advances his maximum
HP and MP increase, depending on his class, species and personal bonuses. At
the moment of advancment he is fully healed and mana is restored to their new
maximum levels.

                          XP Required for Advancement
============================================================================
Level | XP
============================================================================
1     | 0       
2     | 32      
3     | 64      
4     | 128     
5     | 256     
6     | 512     
n     | 2^(n+5)
============================================================================

                                  Attributes

Characters have three basic attributes: Strength, Dexterity and
Intelligence. These are fixed when the character is created and don't change
during the game.

Strength

    Strength limits the total weight of readied weapons and armour. Strong
	characters do more damage and are better at hitting with heavy or
	bludgeoning weapons. It is also used when breaking free of spider webs
	(most trolls don't stay ensnared too long...).

Dexterity

    Dexterity is used when attacking with missile and balanced weaponry, and
	helps when avoiding your opponents' blows. It is also needed when
	picking locks and disarming trapped chests.

Intelligence

    Intelligence makes spells more potent and more likely to succeed.


                                     MAGIC


The example game contains a full complement of spells. The magic system is
similar to Ultima 5 and Ultima 6: you select a spell by entering magic
syllables. A spell name is a combination of one to four syllables.

The syllables, spell names and reagent mixtures provided in the example game
are a direct ripoff of Ultima 5. If you don't have a u5 reference manual lying
around then the tables below will help:

[1] In Towns and Dungeons teleport spells that can move the party from one
    place to another will fail unless combat is over and the party is in Follow
    Mode.


                                    EFFECTS

From time to time your characters might run into a little trouble with magical
foes, natural hazards, or their own weakness for alcohol. Don't panic. Most
effects are non-fatal, but a few are.

Asleep (S)

    Sleeping party members will eventually wake up of their own accord. If you
    don't feel like waiting use the An Zu spell.

Charmed (C)

    Enemy wizards might charm party members, causing them to fight on their
    behalf. Charm wears off after 10 minutes.

Diseased (D)

    Some monsters may infect party members with disease. Disease is not fatal,
    but it will not wear off until your party member is nearly out of hit
    points.

Drunk (A)

    Anytime your character buys alcoholic drinks or picks them up from the
    ground he gets drunk. Drunkenness lasts an hour or so and causes him to
    randomly bump into things.

Ensnared (E)

    When stuck in a spider web, a character will break free after struggling
    for a while. The time required to free himself depends on the character's
    strength.

Paralyzed (Z)

    Spiders inject paralyzing venom to make their foes helpless before feeding
    on them. Paralysis will wear off after a short random interval.

Poisoned (P)

    Bogs or spells may poison party members, causing them to lose hit points
    every turn until the poison is cured with a spell or potion. Poison is
    fatal! It won't wear off like disease.


                                 CONVERSATION


Start a conversation with an NPC with the T)alk command. During conversation
you type simple inquiries and the NPC responds, sometimes asking you a question
in return. Conversations with shopkeepers will allow you to BUY and SELL
items. Most NPCs respond to the 'NAME' and 'JOB' queries, as well as queries
about their town and fellow townsmen. Their responses usually give you clues to
further fruitful queries. Also, with the special 'JOIN' query you can ask an
NPC to join your party (some will join you, and some will join you only if you
do or say something that impresses them).


                                     MISC

Food is consumed three times per day, one unit for each living party
member. When the food runs out, party members take a point of damage at each
meal time.


                             APPENDIX A: MAP HACKING

Like many games, "nazghul" is separated into an engine [2] and some data
files. In this case the data files are written in the Scheme programmming
language. If you examine the default start file 'session.scm' you will see that
it is a scheme file which loads the game types from other files and then
defines the starting game variables.

I encourage people to experiment with modifying the example files or even using
them as a basis to create their own games. The example script code is all
committed to the public domain. The image and sound files come from various
sources - see the COPYING file in the top nazghul directory for details on
where they came from.

If you want to make a proprietary game you may use the example script files,
but you will probably need to make your own image and sound resource files as
the ones in the examples directory come from other open-source or freeware
projects and their copyright holders might object to proprietary use.


                             APPENDIX B: Spoilers

These apply specifically to Haxima, and not necessarily to any other game made
with the Nazghul engine.

FOOTNOTES

[1] Alas, there isn't one. Yet.

[2] I like to refer to it as a "kernel". This makes me feel like it is really
    cool, and like I'm not a loser since Linus Torvalds and I are about the
    same age and he works on a kernel, too.
