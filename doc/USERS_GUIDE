                            USERS GUIDE TO NAZGHUL

Nazghul is an old-school RPG clone modeled after those made in the heyday of
top-down, 2d tile-based graphics. It is specifically modeled after Ultima V, so
if you've played that game then this should be familiar.



                               STARTING THE GAME


The nazghul distribution is laid out as follows:

nazghul-0.x.0
|- doc
|- examples
`- src

First, see the nazghul-0.x.0/INSTALL instructions in the top-level of the
nazghul distribution for instructions on setting up and installing the game.

Next, to play the example that comes with the game cd to nazghul-0.x.0/examples
and run the command nazghul. If your installation worked correctly the game
should fire up.



                                  ORIENTATION


When you start you will be in party mode and the icon for your party will be in
the center of the map view on the left. Later, when you get into trouble with
npcs the map will show you a combat screen. Combat is pretty much the same
except instead of one icon for the party you will see an icon for each party
member.

To exit a city walk off the edge. This will take you to the wilderness map. To
enter a city step onto its icon on the wilderness map. Usually this will take
you right in on the edge you entered from. Sometime you're party will find
itself direcly over the city icon. In that case hit the 'e' key (for 'enter')
and the game will prompt you for a direction to enter from. Note that sometimes
you cannot enter cities because they have no passable terrain on the side you
indicate.

Below the map you'll see a prompt screen. This gives you hints when you're
entering commands to tell you what type of input the command wants. For
example, if you type 'l' (for look) the command prompt will say:

    Look-<direction>

Which means it wants you to hit an arrow key to indicate which direction to
look. If you hit 'ESC' instead the command will cancel. Pretty much all
commands can be canceled by hitting 'ESC'.



                                USER INTERFACE


Astronomy Window

    Above the map you'll see a little window embedded in the frame which shows
    the position of the sun and two moons. It also shows the phase of the
    moons, which is important for moongate travel.

FPS Counter
      
    Not that it matters with a game like this, but for you're idle amusement in
    the top left corner of the map you can see how fast frames are drawing. No,
    we're not really drawing 100 frames per second - the engine only redraws
    when it needs to. 100 fps means each draw - when we get around to it -
    takes 10ms.

Clock

    Eventually I'll make you carry around a pocketwatch but for now you can see
    the current game time by looking in the top right corner of the map window.

Coordinates

    Eventually I'll make you work for this one, too, but for now I nicely
    indicate you're parties coordinates in the lower left corner of the
    map. This is convenient for map hackers to walk around and figure out where
    to put things.

Wind

    Below the map, embedded in the frame, is the wind direction
    indicator. Currently the wind only affects ships. Tacking across the wind
    provides the best rate of travel, the wind at your back is second back, and
    heading into the wind is the worst. Note that this indicates the direction
    the wind is blowing _from_.

Command Prompt

    Unlike u4/u5/u6 the command prompt has its own window, just below the wind
    indicator. Interactive command prompts appear here, as well as the things
    the player says in conversation. BTW, I've thought about moving this back
    to the console window, so if you have an opinion let me know. Sam's says I
    should log the final form of all commands to the console, so that's an
    alternative to consider.

Status Window

    In the top right you have a general-purpose window for viewing and
    selecting lists of things. Normally it shows some basic party stats, but
    its contents change as required by used commands. For example, (R)eady will
    turn it into a selection list.

Foogod Window

    That's my sacrilegious acronym for Food/Gold Window. This little window
    appears below the status window and shows the turn, food and gold counters
    as well as the current combat status. If you board a vehicle it will also
    show you the hit points for the vehicle.

Console Window

    Finally on the right hand side you'll find the window where all the game
    messages get logged.



                                PLAYER COMMANDS


Here's your chance to let the sweat dry on your mouse - all commands are via
the keyboard. As it should be, forever and ever amen.

General syntax:

<dir>    = one of the four arrow keys
<member> = a party member, selected from a list by scrolling with the arrow
           keys and pressing <enter> or <space>

                                MOVEMENT MODES


Party Mode (wilderness/towns)

    The party appears as a single icon in the center of the screen.

Follow Mode (combat/dungeons)

    You control the party leader and the other members follow the
    leader. Attacking a target will automatically switch to Round-Robin
    Mode. The party leader is always the top person in the list who is alive
    and still on the current map. Enter follow mode from Solo or Round Robin
    Mode by pressing 'f'.

Solo Mode (combat/dungeons)

    You control one party member while the others stand around looking
    bored. Enter Solo Mode by pressing the number key associated with the
    party member's order in the list. 1 is the first member in the list.

    NOTE: Follow mode can be very useful if one of your party members has
          greater passability then the others. In the example game Mesmeme the
          gazer can cross water unaided because he floats. This gives him the
          ability to scout places the other members don't normally have access,
          to. For fun, see if you can find a ghost to join your party :). I
          promise I'll put one in the example game. No cheating by looking at
          the scripts!

Round Robin Mode (combat/dungeons)

    You control each member in turn. This is the default mode when you enter
    combat. To enter Round Robin Mode from solo mode, press 0. To enter from
    Follow Mode press 'f'. Yes, confusing to have two methods. I'll fix it
    someday. Let me know if you have an opinion.



                                    PLACES


Towns/Wilderness:

    In the outdoor or wilderness map the party moves as a single unit. You can
    enter into combat with enemy NPC parties by moving into them or waiting for
    them to attack you. Likewise you can enter towns, dungeons or moongates by
    simply walking into them.

Town/Wilderness Combat:

    This is a special temporary combat map that pops up when you engage an
    enemy NPC party in the wilderness. In this mode you control individual
    party members. You return to the wilderness map by having all of your
    living party members walk off the edge of the map. (Hint: if combat is over
    you can press <ESC> to quickly leave the map).

Dungeons:

    In dungeons you move just like in combat mode. You can control the
    individual party members in turn, have one of them scout around in solo
    mode, or control the leader and have the other party members follow.



                                    COMBAT


What can I say? It's pretty much like u5. Try the flaming oil at night or in an
underground place.



                                     MAGIC


The example game contains a full complement of spells. The magic system is
similar to Ultima 5 and Ultima 6: you select a spell by entering magic
syllables. A spell name is a combination of one to four syllables, so the
engine supports up to 26 + (26 * 26) + (26 * 26 * 26) + (26 * 26 * 26 * 26) =
511,758 spells. I hope that's enough. What do you think? Let me know.

Magic Spells

NOTE: These syllables and spells are not hard-coded in the engine. They are
      defined in the script files. Currently the syntax is sort of hackish and
      limited, and not all combinations of effects have been tested (and likely
      never will be). But the goal is to get that all spruced up and accessible
      to people with less free time on their hands than me. If you feel like
      hacking them see the GAME_DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.



                                 CONVERSATION


Start a conversation with an NPC with the T)alk command. During conversation
you type simple inquiries and the NPC responds, sometimes asking you a question
in return. Conversations with shopkeepers will allow you to buy and sell
items. Most NPCs respond to the 'NAME', 'JOB', and 'HEALTH' queries. Their
responses usually give you clues to further fruitful queries. Also, with the
special 'JOIN' query you can ask an NPC to join your party (some will join you,
and some will join you only if you do or say something that impresses
them).



                             APPENDIX: MAP HACKING


Like many games, "nazghul" is separated into an engine and a data file. In this
case the default data file is called 'mapfile' in the example directory. This
file is built from the files in the subdirectories beneath example by invoking
the 'make' command from within examples. I encourage people to experiment with
modifying the examples file or even using it as a basis to create their own
games. The example script code is all committed to the public domain. The image
and sound files come from various sources - see the COPYING file in the top
nazghul directory for details on where they came from.

If you want to make a proprietary game you may use the example script files,
but you will probably need to make your own image and sound resource files as
the ones in the examples directory come from other open-source or freeware
projects and their copyright holders might object to proprietary use.

A more detailed guide to map hacking is under development in the
GAME_DEVELOPERS_GUIDE in this same directory.
