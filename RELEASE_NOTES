Changes for nazghul-0.1.2

--Fixed the bug Sam reported about firing cannons in town. Whenever the cannon
  was fired the turns were updates as if the party was in the wilderness, not
  town. So about 64 turns passed, and if any hostiles happened to be nearby you
  would immediately enter combat. Also spruced up the messages shown when
  firing and fixed the cannonball sprite (finally :-)) in the examples.
