-- Implemented a terrain- and palette-saving command (^S)ave Map.

   The command is bound to CONTROL-S, and writes the current 
   terrain_palette and terrain_map to disk as:
       /tmp/nazghul.pal.pal_tag_name.PID.ghul
       /tmp/nazghul.map.map_tag_name.PID.ghul

   This is useful for map editors in conjunction with (^T)erraform.
   The saved palettes and maps can easily be used in hand-written 
   GhulScript with minimal to no hand-editing of the Nazghul-generated 
   palettes/maps.

   The next step is a command to teleport to a tag-named place, 
   and a command to create a new place of specified width and height.
   With these commands, map creation can be done entirely within Nazghul.
   (Place creation will of course await full game state saving.)

sglasby:
-- Implemented a terrain-editing command (^T)erraform.

   The command is bound to CONTROL-T, and invokes a UI cursoring mode
   in which PageUp/PageDown cycle through terrain to draw with (in the
   current terrain_palette) and (SPACE | ENTER | RETURN) alters terrain.

   The next step is more UI refinements, and a command which saves the
   current map and palette.

   Lots went on under the hood with the terrain, terrain_map, and 
   terrain_palette structs, with event handling in event.[ch],
   and in GhulScript in game.c to make this possible.
   Most of that won't be visible to end-users, and only a little 
   to GhulScript hackers.

   Among the stuff visible to GhulScript hackers:
   o New top-level keyword PALETTE which defines a terrain palette
     as a tagged entity
   o MAP now wants a field 'palette palette_tag_here;' rather than
     a palette {} block
   o types/terrain/terrains.ghul now defines a few PALETTEs, 
     rather than #define-ing palette {} blocks


Changes 2003/06/19
sglasby:

--Finished converting game_load_ascii_terrain_map() to use
  string-oriented terrain {} block parsing rather than
  Loader::getRaw().

  Now, both compact one_char_per_tile maps and single/multi-byte
  palette non-compact maps work alike.  That is, each line is a quoted
  string like "line".

--Added a map-printing function terrain_map_print() which can output
  GhulScript for a MAP.  Work remains to be done, including making
  sure that every terrain_map has its' palette field properly filled
  out, and connecting the palette_print() function.  (Or better yet,
  making palettes globally-scoped entities rather than per-map.)


Changes between nazghul-0.1.1 and nazghul-0.1.2

gmcnutt:

--Fixed the bug Sam reported about firing cannons in town. Whenever the cannon
  was fired the turns were updates as if the party was in the wilderness, not
  town. So about 64 turns passed, and if any hostiles happened to be nearby you
  would immediately enter combat. Also spruced up the messages shown when
  firing and fixed the cannonball sprite (finally :-)) in the examples.

--Fixed bugs related to playing a sound when damage is inflicted. Previously it
  was a hardcoded hack that broke a while back when we split the data files
  into their own directory. The fix was to add an optional 'damage_sound' field
  to both the SPECIES and CHAR declarations. When a character receives damage
  it will first check if it has its own special damage sound to play, otherwise
  it will check if its species has a damage sound to play, otherwise it doesn't
  play anything. This works in the case of damaging npc parties, too (for
  example with ship cannons) because npc party damage calls the character
  damage routines. In the examples I modified all species to play the old
  traditional damage sound.

--Added sound attenuation with distance (hearing the nixies splash around gets
  really annoying when you can't get away from it - need to find some better
  sounds). I only made it apply in party mode because in combat mode it's a bit
  trickier for the code that's playing the sound to figure out which party
  member it needs to calculate the distance from. Since dungeons are not party
  mode I'll probably want to reconsider how to do that.

--Added a COMBAT section to the script. Currently this is only used to declare
  the sound files used in combat for events like entry, defeat and victory.

--Fixed a bug introduced when I fixed cannons firing in town. The npc code was
  not properly incrementing turns when it fired cannons.

--When npc vehicle weapons hit an npc party it was printing "You hit ", as if
  the player was doing the firing. Changed the message from "you" to whatever
  the name of the weapon being fired.

--Fixed a crash that occurred on startup if the --sound 0 option was
  specified.

--Fixed a memory leak. NpcParty objects were not being deleted after combat
  except in the case where the NpcParty initiated combat. Added a new flag to
  the NpcParty class: 'destroy_on_combat_exit'. By default it is true. In the
  case where the NpcParty initiates combat it sets it to false before entering
  combat. After combat the NpcParty will be deleted once it returns to the code
  in place.c which updates objects every turn.

--Added a campsite map, campsite formation and party formation to the examples
  file. Increased the light from a fireplace, too.

--Added a new function in map: mapTileIsVisible checks if a tile is visible
  under the LOS rules.

--Added start of a new town: Green Tower

--Added the (a)ttack command for towns and wilderness. If the target is
  non-hostile it prompts the player for confirmation.

--If the player attacks a non-hostile npc party then the target's alignment
  bits are cleared from the player's alignment bits. In other words, the npc
  party and all of its allies are now the player's enemies. If you attack a
  townsperson all the other townspeople and the guards will attack you if they
  can. Note that they still aren't smart enough to pathfind through impassable
  mechanisms, so a door is enough to hold them off.

--Fixed some issues with sunrise/sunset. The sun now begins to appear in the
  sky window at sunrise, and is completely gone by sunset. The light fades in
  and out over the space of the first hour after sunrise and before sunset,
  respectively. The code to calculate sunlight now uses a single consistent
  forumula, and does so for the moons as well as the sun (more on that below).

--The moons now provide light depending on their arc and phase. They can
  provide at most 128 light units, whereas the sun can provide 255 (max is 255
  due to the way the lightmap gets built in map.c). So even with a full moon
  things are a bit dim.

--Replaced the u4 moon sprites with my own, since mine are 16x16 and u4 is
  only 8x16. Makes the full moons look full.

--The final contents of the cmdwin are now shown on the main console.

--New feature in the console. If a message is a repeat of the last one then
  instead of printing it again the console will print a notice of how many time
  the message has repeated so far. Also changed the way "slow progress" and
  friends are reported so that it takes advantage of this feature.

--Added a new character to Green Tower. Shroom the Hag owns the reagent shop.

--Added a druid class to the example.

--Npc parties in wander mode no longer walk over hazardous terrain. I was
  getting concerned about Shroom walking around in the firepit at the White
  Stag Lodge. :-)

--Bugfix: combat resulting from a conversation was not placing the opponent on
  the combat map. This broke when I made towns function in party mode like the
  wildernesses. Before that change combat just occurred in town so I didn't
  need to setup the npc party in the combat map.

--Bugfix: circular mech activation now has some crude (over)
  protection. Connecting two lights spaceship-style no longer causes the engine
  to crash on stack overflow.

--Added support for the sleep effect to items (previously only spells).

--Party leader is now reevaluated every time some part of the code asks about
  it (I use to try to cache the leader, but this makes things too
  complicated). Also, if the leader falls asleep the next in command takes
  over.

--Fixed sleep fields in combat. Looks they were never processed
  correctly.

--Removed the 'find party' and 'find edge' requirements in combat
  placement. Not sure if this will break something or not, but I decided to do
  this when I found that nixies could not get distributed on a bridge combat
  map. That's just silly, and most of that placement code was written back in
  the day when I wanted the engine to do more ass-covering for map hackers. So
  I removed it. We'll see what happens.

--Fixed the "In Lor" spell by making the caster the default spell
  target. Apparently I commented that line of code out for some reason but I
  don't know why. Should have left a note. This time, I did.

--Bugfix: the character describe method assumed the character had an
  occupation. Some npc characters in the example game don't have an
  occupation. For example, insects in a swarm.

--Bugfix: charmed opponents continued to attack the party. This was a bug
  introduced some time ago when I had characters remember their previous
  targets so that stepping out of LOS would not make them start to wander
  aimlessly. We needed to check if we were still hostile to these remembered
  targets.

--Bugfix: npcs standing on los-blocking terrain in combat no longer blind

--Bugfix: wave sprites now rendered properly when peering (zoomed out by a
  factor of two). There were several bugs contributing to this.

--Added a level beneath Green Tower (to test some spells, but I think I'll keep
  it).

--Added support for the sleep effect to items (previously only spells).

  it (I use to try to cache the leader, but this makes things too

sglasby:

--Rearranged terrain and terrain palette stuff in examples/ Everything
   pertaining to terrain has generally been polished, etc.  Added the
   STD_EXPANDED_PALETTE which uses the 32x32 Runic signs, and fixed up all the
   supporting GhulScript so everything fit together.  Worked towards a better
   ship map, with a couple of caveats (Ship Map bugs)

--Extended how terrain palettes work, which should be invisible to end-users
  and to GhulScript hackers alike.  Obsoleted 'glyph' in terrain definitions,
  only GhulScript hackers who fiddled with the TERRAIN macro would have
  noticed.
