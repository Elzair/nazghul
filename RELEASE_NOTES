Changes for nazghul-0.1.2

--Fixed the bug Sam reported about firing cannons in town. Whenever the cannon
  was fired the turns were updates as if the party was in the wilderness, not
  town. So about 64 turns passed, and if any hostiles happened to be nearby you
  would immediately enter combat. Also spruced up the messages shown when
  firing and fixed the cannonball sprite (finally :-)) in the examples.

--Fixed bugs related to playing a sound when damage is inflicted. Previously it
  was a hardcoded hack that broke a while back when we split the data files
  into their own directory. The fix was to add an optional 'damage_sound' field
  to both the SPECIES and CHAR declarations. When a character receives damage
  it will first check if it has its own special damage sound to play, otherwise
  it will check if its species has a damage sound to play, otherwise it doesn't
  play anything. This works in the case of damaging npc parties, too (for
  example with ship cannons) because npc party damage calls the character
  damage routines. In the examples I modified all species to play the old
  traditional damage sound.

--Added sound attenuation with distance (hearing the nixies splash around gets
  really annoying when you can't get away from it - need to find some better
  sounds). I only made it apply in party mode because in combat mode it's a bit
  trickier for the code that's playing the sound to figure out which party
  member it needs to calculate the distance from. Since dungeons are not party
  mode I'll probably want to reconsider how to do that.

--Added a COMBAT section to the script. Currently this is only used to declare
  the sound files used in combat for events like entry, defeat and victory.

--Fixed a bug introduced when I fixed cannons firing in town. The npc code was
  not properly incrementing turns when it fired cannons.

--When npc vehicle weapons hit an npc party it was printing "You hit ", as if
  the player was doing the firing. Changed the message from "you" to whatever
  the name of the weapon being fired.

--Fixed a crash that occurred on startup if the --sound 0 option was
  specified.

--Fixed a memory leak. NpcParty objects were not being deleted after combat
  except in the case where the NpcParty initiated combat. Added a new flag to
  the NpcParty class: 'destroy_on_combat_exit'. By default it is true. In the
  case where the NpcParty initiates combat it sets it to false before entering
  combat. After combat the NpcParty will be deleted once it returns to the code
  in place.c which updates objects every turn.

--Added a campsite map, campsite formation and party formation to the examples
  file. Increased the light from a fireplace, too.

--Added a new function in map: mapTileIsVisible checks if a tile is visible
  under the LOS rules.

--Added start of a new town: Green Tower

--Added the (a)ttack command for towns and wilderness. If the target is
  non-hostile it prompts the player for confirmation.

--If the player attacks a non-hostile npc party then the target's alignment
  bits are cleared from the player's alignment bits. In other words, the npc
  party and all of its allies are now the player's enemies. If you attack a
  townsperson all the other townspeople and the guards will attack you if they
  can. Note that they still aren't smart enough to pathfind through impassable
  mechanisms, so a door is enough to hold them off.

--Fixed some issues with sunrise/sunset. The sun now begins to appear in the
  sky window at sunrise, and is completely gone by sunset. The light fades in
  and out over the space of the first hour after sunrise and before sunset,
  respectively. The code to calculate sunlight now uses a single consistent
  forumula, and does so for the moons as well as the sun (more on that below).

--The moons now provide light depending on their arc and phase. They can
  provide at most 128 light units, whereas the sun can provide 255 (max is 255
  due to the way the lightmap gets built in map.c). So even with a full moon
  things are a bit dim.

--Replaced the u4 moon sprites with my own, since mine are 16x16 and u4 is
  only 8x16. Makes the full moons look full.
