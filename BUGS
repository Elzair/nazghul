--Nixie attacks sometimes start combat with wrong orientation (hard to
  reproduce)

--Frame sometimes gets messed up and needs a repaint (really? or only during
  debug sessions?)

--spaceship the lightswitch in the dungeon => crash when handled.

--NPC combat behaviour on maps with lots of los-blocking terrain still looks
  weird. NPCs need to be a bit more aggressive, blocked missiles need to be
  reported better; in general I think the user just needs more feedback to
  understand what's going on.

Known BUGS in release 0.1.1

* Firing ship cannons in town at the nixies causes combat to begin immediately,
  regardless of how far away the nixie party is

* Lots of warnings about non-existent sound files
