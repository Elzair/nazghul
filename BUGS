Known bugs in release 0.4.0:

o First keystroke responds slowly (new with UNICODE enablement)

o Start the game, and before pressing a key, look at the astronomy window. It
  should show the current sky, but instead is completely blank.  Press a key,
  and notice that the sky is redrawn correctly.

o Some combinations of (terrain + terrain) or (terrain + terrain + vehicle)
  result in sub-optimal combat maps.  This may be largely fixed/worked around
  by means of better maps in examples/data/world/maps/terrain_combat_maps.ghul

o Some LOS behaviors are still imperfect, such as the view through a window
  when aligned perfectly on a diagonal line.  This might be fixed by manually
  tweaking the generated table for the 1.0 slope.

o Combat placement problem: in some cases -- particularly when the player is
  standing on a bridge -- the opposing party does not get placed on the
  wilderness combat map.

o Ship-to-shore combat can look funny, especially when the bridge terrain is
  involved.
