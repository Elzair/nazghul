--Nixie attacks sometimes start combat with wrong orientation (hard to
  reproduce)

--Frame sometimes gets messed up and needs a repaint (really? or only during
  debug sessions?)

--spaceship the lightswitch in the dungeon => crash when handled

--Converse with guards, let them attack => no guards on combat map

--Set the initial sun arc to sunrise, on bootup the game should have the
  dimmest amount of sunlight and it should account for moonlight; instead we
  get full sunlight

Known BUGS in release 0.1.1

* Firing ship cannons in town at the nixies causes combat to begin immediately,
  regardless of how far away the nixie party is

* Lots of warnings about non-existent sound files
