* Nixie attacks sometimes start combat with wrong orientation (hard to
  reproduce)

* Frame sometimes gets messed up and needs a repaint (really? or only during
  debug sessions?)

* Quoted (Sam favors single quote for glyph conservation purposes) map terrain
  lines for sane syntax highlighting

* spaceship the lightswitch in the dungeon => crash when handled

* Converse with guards, let them attack => no guards on combat map

Known BUGS in release 0.1.1

* Firing ship cannons in town at the nixies causes combat to begin immediately,
  regardless of how far away the nixie party is

* Lots of warnings about non-existent sound files
