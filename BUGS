Known bugs in release 0.1.2

--Nixie attacks sometimes start combat with wrong orientation (hard to
  reproduce)

--Frame sometimes gets messed up and needs a repaint (really? or only during
  debug sessions?)

--NPC combat behaviour on maps with lots of los-blocking terrain still looks
  weird. NPCs need to be a bit more aggressive, blocked missiles need to be
  reported better; in general I think the user just needs more feedback to
  understand what's going on.

--Bridge-nixie problem: nixie's don't get placed because their party is placed
  on impassable terrain and the party members can't pathfind back to the
  party. So I removed find_party as a restriction. Now if the player party
  enters  dungeon one of the members can get placed in a cell where they are
  trapped. Proper solution: restore find-party restriction, make party
  placement more flexible (search at least half the map for a passable location
  for the party), and permit stacking.

--Entering the sotheast ladder of the castle section of Empire City will place
  one of your party members into a prison cell, effectively deadlocking the
  game. This is an unexpected side-effect of removing the find_party
  requirement for combat entry.

--Ship-to-shore combat can look funny, especially when the bridge terrain is
  involved.

--Looks like we segfault upon exit from ship-to-ship combat. Just noticed this
  while preparing the release, so it might be -O2 optimization (meaning an
  uninitialized variable somewhere).

* Firing ship cannons in town at the nixies causes combat to begin immediately,
