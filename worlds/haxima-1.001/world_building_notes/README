This directory contains world-building notes.  

As such, this directory (and its' contents) should not be part of a
non-developer release, since it contains materials which would
constitute spoilers for ordinary players.

Each file is named "yyyy.mm.dd.major_subject.txt" to keep some
pretense of organization (and which came first), though it will
probably begin as, become, and remain quite a mess.

Subjects covered include any world-building topic, including but not
limited to:

- Lists of game object types and object instances

- Discussion of implementation of interesting features within the
  Haxima engine (notes on designing/extending the game engine belong
  in the doc/ subdirectory of the repository/tarball/distribution)

- Lists of, or planning notes for, large-scale and small-scale maps

- Background information about the world 
  - geography
  - sentient beings and their cultures + worldview
  - overall technological (and magical) level
  - flora and fauna
  - astronomy and weather

- time and movement in the game world (transportation, distances, ...)

- RPG mechanics (combat, character advancement, ...)

- lists of (and organizational notes for) creation/selection of media
  (2D tile graphics media, sound media, ...)

- anything else pertaining to world-building
