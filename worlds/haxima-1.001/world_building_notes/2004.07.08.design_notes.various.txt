API stuff for Mechs, Spells, and so forth:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, I will describe various places in a game world, and interesting
features (or occupants) therein which have a bearing on what we need
for the Objects, State Machines, and Signals systems in Nazghul.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Wilderness
------------
The wilderness has:
- A SKY
- Various TERRAIN
- Various contained PLACES, with auto-enter or non-auto-enter portals
- The player PARTY  -- see own section
- a PEACEFUL_NPC_PARTY -- see own section
- a combative MONSTER_PARTY -- see own section


The Sky:
--------
- Has a SUN
- Has a number of MOONS
- Has some number of other ASTRONOMICAL_OBJECTS
- Has weather, including WIND


Sun, Moons, Astronomical objects:
---------------------------------
- Have a direction of movement, and a speed in degrees/hour or similar
- May affect illumination, as the sun does
  This may be by emitting signals when arc changes to a point
  which would alter illumination.  (Probably more generaly than the
  specific code used now.)  The existing implementation works, however.
- May be defined as emitting SIGNALS under astronomically-significant
  times or junctions.
  - For example, the SUN sends signals at DAWN, NOON, DUSK, MIDNIGHT
  - For example, a MOON sends signals at MOONRISE, PERHELION, MOONSET
  - Also, signals for ECLIPSE (body_over, covering_body)
    or CONJUNCTION (body1, body1_phase, body2, body2_phase, ...)
    and similar will be wanted.

Such signals can be used to control illumination, or to open/close
moongates, grow herbs/mushrooms/crops, alter terrain (tides, magical
areas), or whatever.

Portable objects, spells, and so forth that "only work under the full
moon" probably interrogate the moon themselves when invoked.


Wind and other Weather:
-----------------------
Wind controls/effects movement in certain movement modes (flying,
sailing).  Wind or water currents might be implemented as terrain
force vectors, if we have such things.


Interesting Terrain:
--------------------
- Terrain affects movement, in various modes.
  This is probably representable as a 2D grid, 
  where the axes are (movement_mode, terrain_type) 
  and each cell is (0 = impassable, n = movement point cost)

  A "standard cost" terrain, like GRASS for WALKING, costs a number of
  movement points (MP) per tile which is evenly divisible various ways.
  Six or twelve points would be a good choice.  This avoids fractions.
  Larger scales (wilderness) cost proportionally more MP.

  Terrains which offer easier going (ROAD for WALKING) or movement
  modes (perhaps vehicles) which are faster (GRASS for HORSEBACK) cost
  fewer MP than the "standard cost".  More difficult going costs more
  MP.

An example Passability/MP grid:
-------------------------------
        Walk / Ride / Creeping / Climb / Fly / Swim / Boat / Sail
Grass      6   4  12   X   6   X   X   X
Road       4   3  12   X   6   X   X   X
Bridge     4   3  12   X   6   6   6   6
Brush      9   6  12   X   6   X   X   X
L.Forest  12  15  12   X  12   X   X   X
H.Forest  18   X  12   X  12   X   X   X
Hills     18  18  12  18  18   X   X   X
Mountains  X   X   X  30   X   X   X   X
Swamp     12  24  24   X   6  18   X   X
P.Swamp   12* 24* 24*  X   6   6   X   X
Shallow    X   X   X   X   6   6   X   X
Deep       X   X   X   X   6   6*  6   6
Oceanic    X   X   X   X   6   6*  6*  6
Lava

- 'X' denotes impassabililty
- A number denotes how many MP are required
  A larger than "standard" cost means that movement is to some degree
  obstructed, or that additional time is spent moving around
  obstacles, or some such.
- Note that the terrains in this grid are all "large scale" terrains,
  and different behavior on "small scale" similar terrain may apply.
- A number followed by '*' indicates that an effect would be triggered
  by such movement.


Terrain and Effects:
--------------------
- Poisonous swamps (of various types) produce poisoning effects on
  characters that move onto them via WALK or similar movement modes.
  These vary in strength by the specific terrain type, expressed via
  combinations of factors such as:
  - max poison counter
  - how much the poison counter increments per step
  - with what frequency the poison counter turns into damage
  Many other game script implementations could exist.

- Lava and fire terrains cause burning damage, of varying degree.
  Each terrain has a different damage value, which might be a variable
  expression such as (2d6), or a composite value such as
  Intensity: 3, Damage: 3d10+5  (Intensity is compared to strength of
  protection vs fire to see if the protection is applied).
  Other variations could exist.

- Water could cause drowning damage to swimmers, depending on the
  depth, turbulence, or remaining fatigue for the swimmer
  (recharged at some rate once on land).
  Water could also cause hull damage to small or frail watercraft, or
  shallow water or reefs could cause hull damage to larger ships.

- Some terrain may trigger an effect upon attempted (but failed)
  movement, such as a reef or shore causing damage to a ship.
  Hmmm...how about a ship pushed by wind or waves (current) into such
  an obstacle?  Also, consider a spiked wall or thornbush, which
  prevents movement and extracts some pain from the attempt.  We need
  look no further than the behavior of Lava and Force Fields towards
  failed movement, in Ultima III.



Mechanism-like Terrains:
------------------------
Terrain "objects" are references to singleton objects (one for each
terrain type), and as such are not "really" state machines.
However, by changing one terrain for another when a code block is
invoked by some signal, much the same effect can be had.
Some things which could be accomplished via this technique are
described here:

- Seasonal variation of terrain (replacing forest/vegatation terrain
  tiles with seasonal versions of each, changing a road or path to
  a "muddy track" terrain during a wet season or after rainy weather.

- Defining a few types of "beach" and "shallow" terrains which replace
  one another depending on moon phases can provide the effect of
  tides.  Defining more terrain types costs nothing to speak of, so
  this technique should be simple and robust.

- Wilderness-scale drawbridges or floodgates on rivers could be
  implemented, with various control mechanisms.


Interesting Terrain Features:
-----------------------------
Terrain "Features" are non-portable objects which sit on top of a
terrain.  At Town Scale, features such as individual boulders, doors,
portcullis, furniture, and so forth are typical examples.

Terrain features at Wilderness Scale may include roads/paths (which
might be implemented as Terrain instead), or other large-scale
features visible at long range.  Examples are somewhat scarce, since
recent decisions on Wilderness vs Town scale policies would indicate
that features are primarily present on Town Scale.

Ley Lines or a Mana Nexus/Plexus could be implemented as a Wilderness
Scale terrain feature, or as a stenciled "zone".


What Model for Wilderness Scale Wandering Monster Generation?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Do we just roll a chance per turn, then drop down a monster party
completely randomly (on passable terrain)?

Or do we want something more sophisticated.  Perhaps each terrain has
a "danger" attribute and a table of associated terrain-appropriate
monster party types.  When a monster is generated, a weighted
probability determines which terrain type, then the location and
monster party type generated.

And/or, monster-generating mechanisms may cause monster parties to
emerge from dungeon entrances, the middle of dangerous regions
(mountains, swamp, forest) or the like at random intervals.

We should keep as much of this out of the engine as possible, so that
the script can implement arbitrary schemes at our leisure.  In that
manner, it does not become a blocking item on our schedule once a
straw-man placeholder is implemented in the game script.


Contained Places and Their Portals:
-----------------------------------
Towns, Castles, Shrines, Dungeons, and so forth may be "contained" in
a Wilderness scale Place.  The Wilderness Scale portal which connects
the outside tile to the contained Place may be "auto enter" or not.

It is definitely desired that such portals lead to a different
destination (on the N,S,E,W edge of the Place) depending on the
direction of approach/entrance (or the previous interior location, for
cases of re-entry).


What else is interesting in the Wilderness?
Hmmm...I need to discuss Other Wildernesses, such as an Underworld.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Farm
------
- Has some farmers
- Has some domestic animals
- Has some crops
- Has one or more buildings
- Has some structures/tools (terrain features),
  such as a well


Farmers:
--------
- Can converse, ideally sophisticated enough to talk about their
  crops, neighbors, and so forth.
- Have a schedule, including crop-production actions
- Actually perform farm tasks which bring about crops


Domestic Animals:
-----------------
Anything especially notable about them?
Not sure how fast to replace them after butchering...


Crops:
------
Mech-like terrain which cycle between (fallow, young, mature,
harvested) as a result of cultivation/harvesting actions by PC or NPC
action.


Buildings:
----------
Map editor should be able to lay these out via stencil overlay; this
would be a huge time-saver in world creation.


Structures/Tools:
-----------------
- A well to get water, buckets to carry it, useful for crops, animals,
  PC/NPC consumption.
- Some kind of granary container or what have you to store 
  harvested crops
- Portable tools to perform cultivation/harvesting with
  Some are usable as weapons (they are clumsy compared to war-specific
  weapons, though) 




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Town
------
- shops
- merchants
  - of arms and armor
  - of provisions, reagents, and other consumables
  - of effect-bearing consumable items (potions, ...)
  - of livestock/horses
  - of vehicles
  - of real estate

- PC can own a house/shop, NPCs react accordingly
- PC could perform burglary of a residence/shop
- A prison/goal should exist
- PC or NPC could be subjected to time in stocks/pillory
- Various objects emit sound
  - blacksmith working
  - performing bard / jester
  - fountain
  - opening/closing portcullis
