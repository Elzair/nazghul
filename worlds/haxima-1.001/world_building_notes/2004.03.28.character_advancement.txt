Character Advancement Paths
    Warrior (Physical Combat, Warcraft, Leadership)
    Rogue (Skills and Knowledge)
    Wizard (Magical Prowess)
    Wright (Creation and Use of Items)


Each path has Major Archetypes which can be fulfilled.  These are
character types which are highly advanced in skill and power.




Warrior <-- "Basic Path"
-------
Warlord          <-- Major Archetypes
Master of Blades <--


Terminology
-----------
"path" is a sequence, not a node on a graph
a "node" on a graph is called (choose a good name...)
    profession, class, estate, station, title, job, career, ...


NPC party members (main party, other than primary character)
advance towards a _single_ Major Archetype; the player is
less-than-fully in control of their advancement scheme.


Some <nodes> are based upon personal prowess, some are social status,
quest reward, etc.

Hmmm...how about variants like:
    "Master of Blades"        <-- status + prowess
    "Called Master of Blades" <-- status only (NPCs think you are master)
    "Secret Master of Blades" <-- prowess only (NPCs do not know your mastery)


Each <node> has:
    Name
    Pre-requisites to attain
    list/block of Effects

Effects can be:
    attribute mods
    new abilities
    other/special
    can be "negative" effects (for balance, flavor, etc)
and can be:
    immediately acquired
    made available for training/etc
    fulfill 1/n prerequisites for ___


Hmmm, the above makes me thing that <nodes> are very Mech-like.
Is the analogy perfect?  Responds to (suitable) signals, actions occur
on transitions???


How to Attain:
    Trained by NPC / quest / party member / book
    Self study

Attainment/Advancement Cost can be:
    XP (various kinds)
    Time
    Money
    Other

The data structures representing the RPG system must answer various
questions posed by the system (for its' internal purposes in executing
game mechanics) and by the player (for UI purposes, so that the player
can know what the game attributes are, for instance).

An RPG system consists of:
    <values>  quantities such as STR, HP, etc.
              These can be primitive, composite, have random factors,
              and so forth.
    <>
    ...

Consider STR in Diablo II:
    STR = (base STR) + (char points added to STR) + 
          (bonuses from items) + (bonuses from skills) + ...

This illustrates the general rule that an RPG <value> is determined by
some composition of factors.  This is much like a formula in a
spreadsheet cell.

The UI requires more than just the end-result number, however.
The game system, and/or the UI, may require arbitrary introspection of
these factors which produce the <value>.  For example:
    Rule says no more <char_points> to <STR> than <other_value>
    -- This means the RPG system must be able to determine the
       <char_points> spent, so that the limit may be enforced upon
       character load/save, in the UI for character advancement, etc.

    Character stats UI calls for display of total STR, and all the
    factors which result in that total.  Further, mouseover of each
    term should tell "why" that term exists.  For example:
        STR (55) = (15 base) + (20 char points) + 
                   (+15 for STR_spell_C) + (-5 for STR_curse_Z) +
                   (+3 for magic belt) + (2 for moon_power(phase) ) +
                   (+5 for elf_sword and you_are_elf)

These requirements lead me to the following 
objects / data structures + APIs:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<thing_that_produces_an_integer> :=
    integer      |
    RPG_value    |
    dice_handful

<integer> := 
    (the usual)

<dice_handful> :=
    (a dice handful expression, evaluated each time 
    its' value is asked for)

    An <RPG_value> can be used to represent a <dice_handful>, 
    for example:
        2d10+2d6-1d4+3
    by setting factors and rule appropriately:
        (2,10, 2,6, -1,4, 1,3) and (A+B+C+D)
    Hmmm...not quite...this would further require that rule understand
    another primitive, the notion of a simple_die...


RPG_value
  data members:
    owner   // Pointer to an object which "owns" this RPG_value
            // for example, a sword with +STR owns a +STR RPG_value
            // The object pointed to must conform to a protocol,
            // implementing certain methods needed, such as name(),
            // icon(), and I'm not sure what all else...
    factors // List of 1 or more of <thing_that_produces_an_integer>
    rule    // A formulae whose parameters are all from factors,
            // like: (A + B - (C / D) * E)
            // where A,B,C,D,E are the elements of factors

  API:
    value()   // Returns result of evaluating self.rule
    owner()   // Returns self.owner
    factors() // Returns self.factors
    rule()    // Returns a printf-format-like string 
              // based on self.rule, which can be used by UI code to
              // figure out how to display the rule.
              // 
              // For example, (A + B - (C / D) * E) becomes
              //     "('A' + 'B' - ('C' / 'D') * 'E')"
              // The single tick (') is chosen so that traditional
              // math, comparison, and boolean symbols are available
              // for the formulae.
              // 
              // Based on this string, the UI can find out that space
              // to render 5 figures (whose size/length can be found
              // by querying their value) should be allocated in a
              // display region, and the formula displayed.
              // 
              // Mouseover (or whatever) of each element in the
              // formula shows mouseover text indicating the owner(),
              // or acting as a link to the object (equipment item,
              // character skill, buff/nerf effect, ...) which grants
              // the factor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic registration of factors:

There is no "master" formula for all _possible_ factors contributing
to an RPG_value.  As each "effect" is attached to a character (or to
an object which is in turn attached to a character, etc), it calls
some method to "register" that it is a factor altering an RPG_value.

For example, if:
    STR = (base + char_points_spent)
and a +STR buff spell is cast, then this is registered with the
character object.

If the character equips a sword, and then the sword recieves a
+STR_of_wielder buff, then the buff is registered as an effect on the
sword, and the +STR is in turn registered with the character object.

If the character then unwields the sword, the +STR is un-registered.
If the sword +STR_of_wielder buff expires / is dispelled, then the
buff on the sword is unregistered with the sword object, and the +STR
is unregistered with the character object, if applicable.

Character Advancement Paths
    Warrior (Physical Combat, Warcraft, Leadership)
    Rogue (Skills and Knowledge)
    Wizard (Magical Prowess)
    Wright (Creation and Use of Items)


Each <node> has a core-to-path skill (or skill group) associated with
it, and may be named after that skill or skill group.  For example,
the Swordsman <node> is built around the sword skill group.

Skills from other paths are often associated with a <node> of a
particular path; there is considerable overlap.  For example, many
Warrior path <nodes> grant access to Wright skills associated with
(basic) weapon / armor maintenence, and to Rogue skills associated
with (basic) first aid / medical skill + knowledge.
