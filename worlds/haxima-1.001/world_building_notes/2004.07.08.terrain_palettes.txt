Notes on Terrain Palettes:
--------------------------
Fewer palettes are better than many, to avoid palette-merging and such
when blitting two maps together.  However, the semantics of terrain on
different scales calls for disjoint palettes.  

Therefore, two Terrain Palettes are called for:
one for Wilderness scale and one for Town scale. 

Each palette will contain a disjoint set of terrain, appropriate to
the scale.  Both palettes are probably width 3, to allow for the easy
encoding of tide-transforming terrains and such.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wilderness Scale Palette:
-------------------------
Terrain tiles at wilderness scale represent a large region, notionally
about 1 mile square (1760 yards).  The town-scale "interior" maps of a
wilderness tile are not this large, showing rather a region notionally
somewhere within 

This region contains a variety of terrain at town scale, but has a
predominant terrain type which is displayed at wilderness scale and
used to determine questions of wilderness-scale movement, LOS, terrain
effects, and so forth.

Medieval agriculture and population density meant that fields and
cultivated land surrounded urban places in a radius of 5 to 10 miles
(and thus 5 to 10 wilderness tiles).

Linear terrain features such as roads and rivers affect the
passability of entire tiles.  Having different movement ability / cost
for North-South or West-East movement is not a feature of the current
model or game engine.

For this reason, it is possible for terrain tiles to be laid out in a
manner which enables movement, but which is cosmetically wrong, such
as a ship being able to sail from one river onto another which is
placed adjacent with no non-river spaces between.  Correct usage of
terrain whose image suggests not-entire-tile passability is the
responsibility of the map creator.


Wilderness Scale Movement Modes:
--------------------------------
Overland
    * Walking   -- Most common
    * Horseback -- Better movement costs, except over rough terrain
      <other>
      ...snake slithering?
      ...walking over lava?

By Sea
    * Swimming
...various modes, suitable for various depth/roughness of water...
    * Sailing
...various modes for different craft, suitable for various
   depth/roughness of water...

By Air
    * Beast Flying (Low-altitude only)
    * Beast Flying (High-altitude capable)
...which beasts are willing to fly over the astral void?
    * Flying (Balloon)
    * Flying (Airship)
      <others>


Teleportation and Phasing
    * Teleportation -- Destination must be passable to party
    * Xorn Phasing  -- Move through solid rock terrain
      Ghost Phasing -- 
...cannot cross running water, cannot cross a threshold...
      <others>

Special/Other
    * DM-Teleport -- Used by the game editor only
                     Usable in "walk" mode 
                     or as a "choose destination" teleport over distance
                     No restrictions on destination passability


Note on the Palette:
--------------------
It looks like I want:
  - a LOS and LOS-blocking variant of most terrain types
  - passable variants of generally impassable terrain
  - for each effect-bearing terrain, 
    different versions with varying intensity
  - cosmetically-different (snow-covered) versions of terrain
  - tidally-affected terrain variants (shard tilt and lunar tides)


The Wilderness Scale Palette:
-----------------------------
Mountains
  Mountain Peaks
  Mountains (regular, forested, snow-covered)
  Mountain pass -- passable by foot
Hills
  Hills (regular, forested)
  Badlands (cliffs, mesas, and small canyons)
Flat Ground
  Grasslands
  Grasslands (rolling ground) -- blocks LOS
  Bushes
  Bushes (dense) -- blocks LOS
  Forest (light)
  Forest (dense) -- blocks LOS
  Tundra
  Desert
  Wasteland
  Coast/shore (beach, rocky, etc, and tidal variants)
Low Ground
  Swamp (flooded/not, poisonous/not, ...)
Water
  Shallow Water
  Deep Water
  Oceanic Water
Special Terrains
  Lava
  Acid Lake

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Town Scale Palette:
-------------------
Terrain tiles at town scale represent a small region, notionally about
1 yard square.  This is enough space for a human to stand in and move
about normally.  

We presume that a cooperating being of this size can allow another to
move through this space, or by not cooperating, bar passage.  On the
same note, cooperating beings can perform "switch places" movement.

Non-cooperating (and hostile) beings may resort to "push/shove" or
a forcible "switch places" movement, which presumably invokes RPG
mechanics for a test of (size + strength + skill).  This would
generally be a provoking / hostile act.

    (Note that this discussion refers to _theoretical_ capabilities
    within the model of tiled space used here.  Whether in the initial
    release we implement these various forms of movement depends on
    interest + time.)

We may allow smaller beings to multiply occupy the same tile, but do
not allow human-sized beings to end movement in such a position.  An
exception may be standing over a fallen/slain being, or carrying such
a one.

We ignore the question of wielding long two-handed weapons (swords,
axes, spears) within this space without additional room.

We ignore all questions of terrain on a finer scale, such as building
walls less than a yard thick, with an "inside" and an "outside" side
to the wall.  Since we do not make use of the Z axis in this release,
climbing on walls is strictly a matter for special implementation at
special places, rather than a general capability offered by the rules
of space and movement.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now, for a list of terrains, some of which we don't have.
I have noted which ones we have, and in which tileset.

The Wilderness Scale Terrain Palette: (tiles represent ~1x1 mile)
-------------------------------------
Mountains
 Mountain Peaks -- like: peaks in U5 tileset
 Mountains (regular, forested, snow-covered) -- have: regular in u4
 Mountain pass -- should look good with a road/path over it
Hills
 Hills (regular, forested) -- have: regular in u4
 Badlands (cliffs, mesas, and small canyons)
Flat Ground
 Grasslands       -- have: U4
 Fields/croplands -- have: U5
 Orchards
 Bushes           -- have: U4
 Forest           -- have: U4
 Forest (conifer) -- can this be made to look good for the large scale?
 Tundra
 Desert     -- I think the U5 set has a desert tile?
 Wasteland
 Rocky ground -- we could use the existing hill tile
Low Ground
 Swamp (flooded/not, poisonous/not, ...) -- have: plain swamp in U4

     dark/crusted (walkable?), red (liquid), yellow (even hotter liquid)
 Acid Lake (wave or animated)
 Boiling mud (animated)
 Billowing Fog (animated)
