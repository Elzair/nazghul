The engine is now at a point where we need a highly detailed design
for the game to direct engine improvement efforts.

Here are the design criteria and such.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Activities in the Game:
-----------------------------
Exploration

Combat
Use of Magic
Use of Skills (various kinds)
Creation and use of Items
    These imply 4 major areas of character advancement:
        Warrior
        Wizard
        Rogue
        Wright

Character Advancement
    We desire that the player should always be motivated to see what
    kind of advancement is possible just around the bend.

    Some parts of the advancement tree(s) are initially visible, and
    documented in the game documentation.  However, some parts are NOT
    initially visible, and only become visible when certain
    advancement choices are made, etc.

Quests
    Hand-coded content quests
    Randomly generated quests
        In general, we require that many/most elements in the game be
        randomly generable (outdoors maps, town/dungeon carving, NPC
        foe/townsman creation, etc.).  This is a valuable capability
        which extends our content creation beyond our limited
        manpower.  The success of NetHack and Diablo demonstrate the
        value of randomly generated content.

Trading
    Weapons, armor, raw materials, ...
    Even a simplistic NPC economy would be a very cool feature.

Collection and Display of Stuff
    Monster memory
    Stats/Journal page displaying accomplishments
        (Monster kills, titles, reputations, ...)
    Home base with trophy display region

Gladiatorial Combat Stuff
    advancement of ranks
    means of getting a grubstake
    trying out party combinations in a sample combat
    recruiting random or Named NPCs


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Game Elements:
--------------------
Advancement Primarily by Career Paths
    Membership / Titles gained, which grant one-time bonuses
        and increased access to advancement trees.
    Example:  Starting character chooses a very generic title from
    (fighter, rogue, magician, wright) and later achieves titles/ranks
    such as (Swordsman, Sword Master, Dragon Slayer, General, ...)
    (Wizard of the Green, Necromancer's Apprentice, Adept, Arch-Mage, ...)
    (Thief, Second-Story Man, Grifter, Thief Lord, ...)
    (Alchemist's Apprentice, Master of the Alembic, Blade-Forger, ...)

Exploration of Random, Temporarily-Available Regions

Multiple Sentient Species
    Humans, Uruk, Giants, ..., Undead, Dark Things Below, ...
    Civilized, Tribal, Feral, historical dead groups

Multiple Political/Tribal Entities
    Tribes, Nations, Guilds and Societies

Factional Alignments / Reputations

NPC Memories and Attitude
    PC knows NPC name, NPC knows PC name
    Things that vary with attitude (prices, information, ...)
    .

Recruitment of NPC party members
    Main focus is on the central character, but a party is likely


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to Specify:
------------------
Detailed game maps (world, towns, dungeons)
    Use of stencils and overlays over generated terrain

RPG game mechanics, and detailed notes on implementation

Advancement Trees with skills, attribute mods, special abilities

Two Phases for some things to specify:
    Initial list showing the breadth of things, so that it is known
    what capabilities are needed to implement skills or whatever

    Thorough and complete list so that media resources (art, sound,
    etc) can be commissioned.

Items
    Armor, Weapons, Usable portable items

Terrain
    Movement types, costs, effects, visibility

Terrain Features / Furniture

Skills

Spells

Item Creation matrix
    Weapon and Armor creation
    Potions and consumables (alchemy)

Vehicles

Species
    Sentient folk
    Monsters
    Animals


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Questions:
----------------
Occupations are problematic
    Monsters and most NPCs are simple
    The character (and party members, major NPCs) use a more complex
    system however.

    Figure out what is needed for expressivity, and what is
    implementable.

Factory Classes vs Instance Classes:
    NPC Party class to roll up a "gazer party"
    vs data structures to represent the party, and the individuals in it

Effects sytem in Terrain and Spell to use Effect Blocks


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: (My deliverables)
-----
Art proposal/bid materrials to give to artists.
This should include:
    Specifications for tile art (32x32 pixel, palette, PNG or whatever)
    Examples of tile art
    Guidelines for tile art (perspective, lighting, ...)

    Proto-specifications for portrait art
    ...

    Proto-specifications for paperdoll art
    ...

    Stuff for sample submissions for other art
    (wallpaper, concept art, graphics for WWW site, ...)


See notes in

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Portrait Art and the Conversation UI:
-------------------------------------
We want to be ABLE to use a variety of existing portrait art from
various sources.  For this reason, we ACCEPT a RANGE of sizes, and one
can optionally specify a (width, height) to crop to.

The conversation UI consists of "portrait regions" on the left and
right sides of the screen, starting at the top.

One or more portraits occupy each portrait stack on each side.

The left side is for "them" (NPCs participating) and the right side is
for "us" (party character initating conversation and other party
members participating). 

First, the screen (1024 x 768 pixels) has a 16 pixel frame on all four
edges.  The left and right portrait stacks are 3 portrait regions
each, coming down from the upper left and upper right corners.

If fewer than 3 portrait regions are used in a portrait stack,
the area below will display a neutral/blank color.

A portrait region is:
Height:  208 pixels
    160 pixels high for the image 
    plus 32 pixels high for 
        name / title / other text associated with the portrait
    plus a 16 pixel frame piece on the bottom.
Width:  176 pixels
    160 pixels wide for the image
    plus a 16 pixel frame piece on the left/right

Portrait images smaller than (160 x 160 pixels)
will be centered along both dimensions.

The center region will display interleaved conversation text,
with each block marked as to what character said it (plus color
coding), and the bottom center will show a text entry region for
conversation responses.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shopping/Inventory/Equipping UI:
--------------------------------
We designed shopping and inventory management UI.
(Library closing soon, must type faster...)




Private/Owned Items:
--------------------
We discussed many complex models for "private" character ownership of
items or inventories.

We decided that what is actually wanted (at this time) is the simple
scheme of items having a field (usually empty) for "owner".

The owned item can be equipped by that character, or un-equipped and
in the party inventory, but no other character is allowed to equip it,
or sell it, or drop it.

If the character dies, the field is not cleared.  The field only takes
effect if the character is alive???


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action Items:
-------------
Gordon anticipates having load and save code complete and working by
next meeting!

I will concentrate on 
    More UI specs and thoughts (esp. inventory and shopping)
    World design stuff
    RPG system stuff
    Objects and creatures in world


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2004/04/05 (Friday)
-------------------
Global conversation geometry
    Quests and such in the game mean conversation topics in the
    root-level, which all will respond to, even if to say they don't
    know.  But they will reply with a diffferent "I don't know" than
    for a completely unknown topic.

Multiple conversation replies
    For a particular topic, multiple possible replies (random
    selection).  This ensures variety of response.

Adjective substitution in conversation texts
    <player_title> <player_name> and similar...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2004/03/11 (Thursday)
---------------------
RPG mechanics must stress that this is a _tactical_ game.

action points/round
    do not vary from round to round, because
    requirement:  predictable initiative order among the party

action points saved in a fund for "push" actions (more AP needed in a
round than ordinary) -- this would work like fatigue over a
multi-round battle, as these points got used up...


Monster attacks on town/castle
    while player is present in that place (various timings)
    while player is in the wilderness (probably within view)


Character Types:
    Summoner
    Enchanter
    Elementalist
    Illusionist
    Necromancer
    ...
    Druid
    Ranger
    Bard
    ...
    Alchemist
    Scribe
    Smith
    Tinker
    ...
    (rogue types)
    ...
    (warrior types)


Places Needed:
    start location
    small town near start location
    larger, fortified town
    fortified castle
    port towns (multiple, else no destinations for sea voyage)
    ...

Basic Activities in the Game
----------------------------
These must be chosen for suitability on the following criteria:
  - The activity would be fun to do in the game
  - The activity can be implemented with a reasonable UI
  - The activity does not require unusual amounts of engine support


Basic Activities (very high level)
----------------
Exploration (on foot, by sea, by air)
Combat (melee, missile, spells)
Character Advancement (warrior, mage, rogue, artisan paths)
Gather Valuables (find, buy, sell, trade)
Converse with NPCs


Basic Activities (more detailed view)
----------------
Exploration
    On Foot
        Land travel (foot, horse, etc) is the primary mode of travel.
        It will be used exclusively at the beginning of the game, and
        will containue to be a major means of travel at all stages of
        the game.

        Obstacles (visual, passability) require finding routes to
        places, which increases the exploration density within a given
        size region.

        Obstacles include rivers (with bridges, fords, or ferry),
        mountain range, swamp, lava, and chasms.

        Another kind of obstacle is that of a dangerous region, where
        the player discovers that movement past a certain radius of a
        town, or within a guarded/dangerous region, is imperiled by
        dangerous creatures.  Such an obstacle will require that the
        player use superior tactics, improved battle prowess, stealth,
        persistence + luck, or to find a special, safe route.

        Advanced land travel (horses, caravan) does not increase the
        type of terrain which can be travelled across (a solitary
        wanderer or small group such as the party, on foot, can cross
        more kinds of terrain than mounted groups or land vehicles).
        However, travel by horseback is at increased speed, and travel
        among a caravan (as a passenger, or leading the caravan and
        directing its' travel) greatly decreases the threat of monster
        encounters and night ambushes.

    By Sea
        Sea travel (raft, boat, ship, etc) is a major mode of travel.
        Islands and continents are isolated by narrow or vast
        stretches of water.  Solitary islands can only be discovered
        by travelling the expanses of the oceans and seas.

        Obstacles to water travel include reefs, strong currents,
        regions with numerous dangerous creatures or weather phenomena
        (whirlpools, twisters), wide landmasses, regions of polar ice,
        regions of boiling sea (surrounding lava?), and the edge of
        the world (or a vast chasm).

        Water travel within a landmass (rivers, lakes) is also a
        consideration.  Regions only accessible by inland river/lake
        travel can be tantalizingly visible in earlier stages of the
        game, promising a later reward.

        Unlike land travel, water travel is initially unavailable and
        access to vessels progresses from lesser to greater.  Lesser
        vehicles (rafts, small boats) are available earlier in the
        game than greater vehicles (ocean-sailing ships, and warships
        with armaments).  Access to water travel as a passenger
        (raft/ferry, hired boat, passage on a ship) is available
        before ownership and captaincy of a vessel.

    By Air
        Air travel is the least common form of conventional travel,
        with a limited role.  Balloons and airships exist, as well as
        flying mounts, each with their limitations.

        Balloons are difficult to control, their movement determined
        by the wind.  They can however travel at a low or high
        altitude, and can potentially travel to any place with a
        suitable landing zone (flat terrain such as grasslands).

        Airships can only land/dock at particular places, and are
        restricted to high altitude travel elsewhere, perhaps on
        specific routes.  If we develop inter-shard travel in a major
        way, airships are probably the primary vehicles in the void
        between shards.  If "high altitude" travel proves problematic
        to handle in the game engine, we can restrict airships to
        particular routes (commercial and for travel to/from specific
        quest locations).

        Flying mounts may exist, and can be directed against the wind
        plus land on rougher terrain than a balloon.  However, they
        have a limited stamina per flight and per day.  Flying mounts
        will forcibly insist on landing before their per-trip stamina
        is exhausted, and must rest overnight to recover per-day
        stamina.  Stamina is consumed by flying, at an accelerated
        rate flying crosswind and more so flying upwind.  Per-trip
        stamina recovers at some rate per turn when landed and
        resting.  Flying creatures which are not mounts presumably
        experience stamina consumption, but without the additional
        load/strain of carrying riders and cargo, concerns of stamina
        are less limiting.

    Magical / Gate Travel
        Networks of magical portals and moongates allow nearly
        instantaneous travel, and travel to unknown regions which may
        belong to another dimension.  Access to this kind of travel is
        gained by finding the portal locations, discovering how to
        predict their destination, and activating individual portals.

        Simple portal networks such as those in Diablo II require only
        that the player discover each portal and "activate" them.
        Particular portals may require a keyed object, such as the
        portal scrolls in Divine Divinity.  Portals could also be
        activated as a quest reward, by operating a mechanism, or by
        casting a spell or ritual.

        It will be desirable to have multiple portal networks, from
        the trivial (a few within one dungeon) to the extensive (the
        primary moongate system, comprising several to many portals
        across continents).

        Further, at least certain portal networks will have complex
        patterns of use, keyed to time and the phases of astronomical
        objects.  The use of one-way portals will add interest and
        peril to such exploration.  A consistent nomenclature and
        visual appearance for different portal types is necessary to
        give clues and reward the player for learning about the game
        world.  In this manner, the player will learn that certain
        color portals behave in a particular way, portals surrounded
        by a certain number of monoliths in another, and so forth.

        Magical gate / portal travel is present from the earliest
        phases of the game to the most advanced.  Mastering particular
        portals networks and learning of entirely new systems of
        portals represent significant player accomplishments.

        Note that it is not desirable for gate travel to become
        routine.  For this reason, portals should not be placed with
        too great a convenience, and other elements should ensure that
        portal travel stays novel and unusual.

        I propose measures including randomness/danger/risk in portal
        travel, and NPC / monster manipulation of the portal
        networks.  In at least one point in the game, a conveniently-
        placed portal (perhaps in the middle of a town) which has been
        activated by the player should be the origin of a monster raid
        on that town!  Further, scripted events in the game where a
        portal is activated or deactivated by an NPC faction (friend
        or foe, folk or monsters) have considerable potential.
        Consider a "routine" gate journey ending up at an unknown and
        dangerous destination because the intended destination portal
        has been deactivated / re-routed by NPC actions...

Combat
    Tactical combat is a major game activity, and much of the game and
    RPG system will be designed to ensure that it is entertaining and
    challenging.

    Movement and Maneuver
        Combat in Nazghul is _tactical_, which means that movement and
        maneuver, formation, etc are of key importance.  Melee /
        missile combat considerations of reach/range are the most
        obvious things affected, tactical considerations such as
        surrounding foes, pursuit and being pursued must be considered
        also.

        One basic conclusion is that in a typical character's turn,
        whatever the "Action Point" scheme, a character can either
        move _multiple_ tiles, or move a single tile before/after a
        combat action such as attacking or spellcasting.

    Melee
        The basic tactical elements in melee are 
            attack vs defense vs damage
                ability to choose "tactics" trading off 
                to-hit accuracy vs defense vs damage
            weapon selection
                blunt vs edged vs piercing, reach weapons, 
                weapon + shield vs 2 weapon style vs 2H weapon,
                special weapon effects (flaming sword, trident vs fish)
            reach
                melee weapons with reach > 1 exist, and are key for
                many formation ideas such as spearmen from the second
                row attacking.  Also, consider "attacks of opportunity"
                when rushing a spearman or similar.
            special attacks / maneuvers
                knockdown, disarming, sunder weapon/shield
                many others are possible

    Missile
        The primary considerations are
            range
            accuracy vs damage
            special attacks / maneuvers

        UI display considerations require
            8 (or 16 or 24) missile facings to show flight path

            4 (or 8) character facings for an attack action with
            missile weapon.  Thrown, sling, bow, crossbow attacks 
            are different animations.

            Weapons like a triple crossbow (fires 3 bolts at same
            target or multiple targets near one another) need to be
            provided for.

            Boomerang requires that a _returning_ flight path also be
            animated, and a "catch" animation.

    Spells
        The main ways spells are used in battle include
            direct damage, single target (bolt / missile)
            direct damage, area effect (beam / blast)
            nerf / debuff foe (single or area)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summoning
---------
Summoning is the art of using magic to call creatures from another
place or another dimension.

Contact Being (communication only)
    useful to make a pact, or to gain information

Summon Being (physically transport a being to a point near the caster)
    useful for combat, to perform a task, or for subsequent binding
    Summoned beings may be controlled, or not
    The Summoning may be for a short time (combat rounds)
        or for a modest time (hours or days)
    Longer durations require a special pact, or a binding

Call Being (call a being, who may transport himself)
    you can Call beings too powerful to Summon

Pact with Being (make some trade for some benefit)
    can be used to enable future Summoning / Calling
    can be used to enable long-term Summoning
    can be used to gain powers from the Contacted being

Bind Being (bind and coerce a being into servitude)
    can be used to enable future Summoning / Calling
    can be used to enable long-term or semi-permanent Summoning
    can be used to gain powers from the Contacted being
    can be used to coerce a Summoned being to inhabit a place, to
        imbue that place with some effect 
        (mana regeneration, light/darkness, many others)
    can be used to coerce a Summoned being to inhabit a physical
        object, to imbue that object with power
        (some magical items are empowered by bound entities)

Summoning/Planar-oriented Divination
...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major question of pacing and mood:

How long to delay the player's discovery that the world is flat?
By what means to delay this knowledge?

initiative and UI, and character advancement


Action Items:
-------------
I will make more notes in a similar vein to recent stuff.

In particular, detail more character classes
    Also, more detail on character classes and advancement

Notes on spells, effects and such which are hard to implement
    In particular, buffs and nerfs and "damage objects" which attach
    to beings, objects, terrain, etc are interesting

Info on the API invocable by spells/mechs/conversations and so forth
    (Things like blit_terrain, ...)

  (ESC, sounds, prompting, ...)

  (top-down functional design)
- kernal design spec 
  (define how the C kernal and the script talk to one another)
  

Meeting after next (2004/04/29), we plan to be done with
specifications, and engine coding can resume.
Also, by that time, I shall endeavor to deliver an initial scope and
schedule for the RPG system used in Nazghul.

Gordon is sending me email with info on the latest dev branch and
such.
