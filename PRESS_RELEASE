nazghul-0.1.4, the latest development release of the nazghul CRPG engine, is
now available for download. The goal of this release was to convert towns to
function like dungeons and combat zones instead of like wilderness zones.

With this change the player can control individual party members in town, fight
battles on town maps and explore regions that are only passable to certain
party members.

To demonstrate some of these features in the sample world a monster generator
was placed in the city of Glasdrin. A full complement of eight moongates,
including some in towns, was also added. Also I'll give you a bit of a spoiler
and tell you that Olin the ghost in Empire City will join you, which is quite
interesting because he can walk through walls. You just have to find him.

Have fun.
