The author of the very nice angband tileset is Adam Bolt, but I
have had no success in contacting him. If anyone knows how to contact him
please email me at gmcnutt@cableone.net. These tilesets were obtained from 
http://www.thangorodrim.net/download.html. Thanks to Adam - I hope he doesn't
mind - and the Thangorodrim website for providing these downloads.

The excellent u4 upgrade tiles were obtained from
http://www.moongates.com/u4/images/misc/shapes.gif. The Ultima Moongates
website gives explicit permission to use these tiles in other projects. Thanks,
guys!

The sounds were obtained from some forgotten site somewhere that did not report
any copying information. Unfortunately I don't know who created them so I can't
give proper credit.

The Scheme files found in the test and world directories are released to
the public domain.

Copying, modifying, bundling, and burning to new ROMs is encouraged!
